# pixivdwn

![Crates.io Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/pixivdwn)

`pixivdwn` is an "incremental" Pixiv downloader, in the sense that it tries to cache fetched information, patch them during update, and allowing powerful querying. It is optimized to run as an unattended periodic background job. It keeps track of illustrations in a local database, and enables the user to selectively download some of the illustrations.
